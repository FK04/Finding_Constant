# 🔐 Finding Constant

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of **Shamir’s Secret Sharing** to reconstruct a hidden constant from given shares.  
It focuses on the core logic of secret reconstruction using polynomial interpolation.

---

## ⚙️ What It Does
- Reads secret shares from JSON test files  
- Applies Shamir’s Secret Sharing logic  
- Reconstructs the original constant securely  

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Java  
- JSON

---

## ▶️ How to Run
Compile and run the Java file:
```bash
javac ShamirSecretSharing.java
java ShamirSecretSharing
```

---

## 📌 Use Case
- Cryptography learning
- Secure data sharing concepts
- Academic and practice projects
